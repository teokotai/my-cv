    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
    <h3>Working Student at IBM Romania</h3>
    <p>July 2022 - September 2022</p>
    <h4>The department where the internship took place:</h4>
    <ul><li>Big Data</li></ul>
    <h4>Tools used for the project:</h4>
    <ul>
        <ul>
            <li>IntelliJ IDE</li>
            <li>Maven</li>
            <li>Git</li>
            <li>Spark</li>
            <li>MySQL</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>Based on the Erasmus mobility data and using the Big Data approach, the application will generate various statistics
        for each country, for example how many students participated in this program.
        IntelliJ IDEA has been used to develop the application using the Java programming language. Maven is a tool that was
        used for building and managing the Java project. Spark is a processing system used for big data workloads to detect
        patterns, and provide real-time insight. It was used for filtering and grouping certain requirements based on the
        Erasmus database. With MySQL we were able to see the content of the tables according to the required filters.
        The goal of this project was to understand the basic concepts of each tool used and to become familiar with
        teamwork in a company.</p>
    <h3>Trade Worker at Profi</h3>

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <h3><li>Chat Application</li></h3>
    <h4>Tools used for the project:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Java</li>
        <li>Android Studio</li>
        <li>Firebase</li>
        <li>XML</li>
        <li>Gradle</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I developed a responsive app using Java on Android Studio that allows users to chat with each other. Utilized Google
        Firebase for the data base that allows user to log in with their phone number and an OTP. Implemented CRUD
        operations, Google Places API for auto completing the location and a Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) API to send
        notifications to users. Utilized XML for defining the layouts and design of the user interface. Gradle was used to build
        the project by defining custom and flexible configurations. Used a Search Query to search different users based on
        multiple filters.</p>

   <h3><li>Face Recognition App</li></h3>
    <h4>Tools used for the project:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>Visual Studio Code</li>
        <li>CustomTkinter</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This Python-based Facial Recognition App provides an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) for face detection and
        recognition using OpenCV, face_recognition, and CustomTkinter. Users can easily acquire images, add and delete
        recognized faces from a local database, and perform face matching.</p>

   <h3><li>Weather App</li></h3>
    <h4>Tools used for the project:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Java</li>
        <li>Android Studio</li>
        <li>Weather API</li>
        <li>XML</li>
        <li>Gradle</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The user can find out hourly outdoor temperatures and wind speed anytime and anywhere by typing the desired
        location in the Search box. All these features are given by the location of the mobile phone.
        Android Studio was used for the Android app development, testing and debugging. Java was the main programing
        language and the XML helped me create the graphical user interface. Gradle helped me build the project by defining
        custom and flexible configurations. To access the current weather data for any location and hourly forecast we used
        a Weather API.</p>

   <h3><li>Calculator</li></h3>
    <h4>Tools used for the project:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>C++</li>
        <li>Arduino IDE</li>
        <li>Arduino UNO Board</li>
        <li>LCD Display</li>
        <li>Keypad</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The calculator can perform various arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and
        modulus. The C++ programming language was used for the project, and the Arduino IDE software was used to write,
        compile and upload the code to the Arduino UNO board. The hardware components mentioned above were used to
        make the project possible. The Arduino UNO board processes the information, and then the keypad is used to enter
        certain operations, which are later displayed on the LCD display.</p>
